==============
The source code for an assignment used for Multimedia Games Programming module at university.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and network difficulties, DRY and MVC principles were not fully adhered to and the 
project was not built into an app. 

Please note that due to issues with the University's network, some files may have been corrupted on saving and/or compressing and as such collision detection on the second and third levels. However, different machines seem to display different results.

The project was coded in Objective-C for iOS, using Cocos2d framework.

Code has been cited where necessary.

All the image assets were created by myself in Adobe Photoshop.

The music was sourced from http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/
