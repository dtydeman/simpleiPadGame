==============
The source code for an assignment used for Multimedia Games Programming module at university.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and network difficulties, DRY and MVC principles were not fully adhered to and the 
project was not built into an app. The network issues may have also damaged the binary files on saving (unsure as different
 machines seem to display different results).

The project was coded in Objective-C for iOS, using Cocos2d framework.

Code has been cited where necessary.

All the image assets were created by myself in Adobe Photoshop.

The music was sourced from http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/
